        <p>Raisins, often referred to as “Kishmish,” defy judgments based on their shriveled, aged, and dry appearance. These dried fruits, available in golden, black-ish, and green hues, are nutritional powerhouses. Packed with fiber, iron, calcium, potassium, and various essential nutrients, they offer an energy boost and contribute to the health of hair and skin.

        <img src="wallnits.jpeg" alt="wallnits" width="500px">
        <p>A walnut is the edible seed of any tree of the genus Juglans (family Juglandaceae), particularly the Persian or English walnut, Juglans regia. They are accessory fruit because the outer covering of the fruit is technically an involucre and thus not morphologically part of the carpel; this means it cannot be a drupe but is instead a drupe-like nut</p>
